# 20 Games Challenge - Game #2 - Jetpack Joyride

This is my second entry in my quest to teach myself game development by creating 20 games inspired by influential titles from gaming history, both recent and retro, from Flappy Bird, to Portal, and beyond(?)!

You can read more about the challenge and my motivations in [my blog post](https://www.veryth.ink/blog/starting-20-games-challenge).

Or you can read about my process building this project ~~here~~ soon!

Please, watch your step, and don't mind the mess, I'm learning here. ðŸ‘·
